# Cognitive Load–Aware Interface Design (HCI Case Study)

A psychology driven HCI project that applies cognitive load theory to analyze and design interface interventions aimed at reducing mental effort and improving task efficiency.

## Overview

This project investigates how **interface design choices contribute to cognitive overload**, particularly under conditions of fatigue and low attentional resources.
Using principles from **cognitive psychology and Human Computer Interaction (HCI)**, the project analyzes real world interfaces and proposes **cognitively aligned design interventions**.

The focus is not on engagement optimization, but on **protecting human attention and working memory.**

## Motivation

Modern digital interfaces often assume unlimited attention and cognitive capacity.
However, cognitive psychology shows that humans have:

- Limited attention

- Limited working memory (≈ 4 chunks)

- Reduced cognitive efficiency under stress or poor sleep

This project explores how interface design can either **amplify cognitive overload** or **support attentional recovery**, especially during vulnerable usage moments such as late-night scrolling.

## Theoretical Foundation

This project is grounded in:

- Cognitive Load Theory

- Working Memory limitations

- Attentional control and fatigue

- Human information processing constraints

Psychological concepts are used as **design constraints**, not metaphors.

## Project Scope
### Focused Usage Moment

Prolonged late night scrolling on Instagram, when users are cognitively fatigued and attentional resources are already depleted.

### Identified Cognitive Failure

The primary cognitive failure examined is ***sustained attentional engagement without adequate recovery.***
Infinite scroll interfaces lack stopping cues or completion signals, forcing attention to remain continuously engaged and preventing natural disengagement.

### Cognitive Design Goal

To introduce **interface signals that indicate task completion or natural breakpoints**, enabling intentional disengagement and reducing attentional fatigue without relying on self-control alone.

## Interfaces Studied

- **Instagram** — visual instability, infinite scroll, high affordance density

- **Spotify** — algorithmic uncertainty, split attention, hidden navigation complexity

These interfaces were selected due to their high daily usage and strong attentional demands.

## Methodology

### 1. Cognitive Load Audit
Identification of extraneous cognitive load sources in real interfaces.

### 2. Psychological Mapping
Linking interface features to working memory limits and attentional mechanisms.

### 3. Design Interventions
Proposing cognitively aligned interface changes based on theory.

### 4. Wireframing (Conceptual)
Visual representation of redesigned interaction flows (Instagram only).

## Design Principles Applied

- Minimize extraneous cognitive load

- Respect attentional limits and recovery needs

- Reduce prediction and monitoring load

- Match system pace to human cognition

These principles guide all design decisions in the project.

## Deliverables

- Cognitive audits of Instagram and Spotify

- Design intervention documents

- Figma wireframe for Instagram redesign

- Theory backed design rationale (documentation-first approach)

## What This Project Is (and Is Not)

**This project is:**

- An HCI + cognitive psychology case study

- Theory driven and design focused

- Suitable for psychology, HCI, and human centered tech portfolios

**This project is not:**

- A machine learning project

- A UI beautification exercise

- An engagement optimization study

## Future Extensions

- Controlled user testing (task time, fatigue, disengagement rate)

- ML-based adaptive interfaces (optional future work)

- Experimental validation using cognitive load metrics

# Project Scope

## Project Focus
This project focuses on the moment when a user engages in prolonged, late-night scrolling on Instagram.

## Identified Cognitive Failure
The primary cognitive failure is sustained attentional engagement without adequate recovery.
Due to the absence of stopping cues in the infinite scroll interface, attention remains continuously engaged, preventing natural disengagement and cognitive rest.

## Cognitive Design Goal
The goal of this redesign is to introduce interface signals that indicate task completion or natural breakpoints, enabling users to disengage intentionally and reduce attentional fatigue

## Non-Goals

This project does not aim to optimize engagement, retention, or monetization metrics.  
The focus is on cognitive sustainability and attentional protection under fatigue.

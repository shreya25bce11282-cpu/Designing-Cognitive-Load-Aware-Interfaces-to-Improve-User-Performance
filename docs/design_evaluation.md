# Design Evaluation Using Cognitive Load Principles

## Evaluation Framework
This project evaluates interface designs using principles from cognitive psychology, focusing on attention, working memory, and cognitive load.

## Metric 1: Attention Continuity
Poor interfaces fragment attention through constant reorientation and lack of stopping cues.

In the original interface:
- Continuous scrolling forces sustained attention with no recovery.

In the redesigned interface:
- Session boundaries allow attentional rest.
- Clear completion signals reduce attentional fatigue.

## Metric 2: Working Memory Load
Working memory is limited to approximately four chunks of information.

In the original interface:
- Multiple simultaneous affordances overload working memory.

In the redesigned interface:
- Actions are reduced and progressively disclosed.
- Only task relevant information is shown per screen.

## Metric 3: Prediction and Monitoring Load
Uncertainty increases cognitive effort and monitoring demand.

In the original interface:
- Algorithmic unpredictability forces constant monitoring.

In the redesigned interface:
- Predictable content flow reduces monitoring effort.

## Metric 4: Cognitive Recovery
Cognitive systems require rest to maintain performance.

In the redesigned interface:
- Explicit pause and exit cues encourage recovery.

## Future Validation

These interventions could be empirically evaluated using task completion time, subjective fatigue measures, and disengagement latency under controlled cognitive load conditions.

# Design Intervention: Instagram

## Cognitive Problem Identified
Late night infinite scrolling causes sustained attentional capture without recovery.
The absence of stopping cues leads to working memory fatigue and attentional collapse.

## Psychological Constraint
- Attention requires recovery
- Working memory overload increases stress
- Continuous stimulation prevents consolidation and rest

## Design Goal
Introduce a cognitive stopping cue that protects attention without blocking user autonomy.

## Proposed Design Change
Add a “session boundary” after prolonged scrolling:
- A calm, low stimulation screen
- No autoplay content
- Explicit rest cue (e.g., “You’ve caught up”)

## Psychological Justification
Stopping cues reduce extraneous cognitive load by:
- Ending sustained attentional demand
- Allowing working memory to disengage
- Supporting emotional regulation under fatigue

## Why This Is Better Than Current Design
The current design maximizes engagement.
This design maximizes **cognitive sustainability**.

*Cognitive Load–Aware Interface Design*

This directory contains the theoretical analysis, cognitive audits, and design rationale supporting the Cognitive Load–Aware Interface Design project.

The documents are structured to reflect a research-style progression:
from psychological theory → interface analysis → design intervention → evaluation.

Readers are encouraged to follow the order below for conceptual clarity.

---

## 1. Theoretical & Conceptual Foundation

These documents establish the cognitive science principles that guide all later analysis and design decisions.

- **hci_intro.md**  
  Introduces the project from a Human–Computer Interaction and cognitive psychology perspective, outlining why cognitive constraints should act as design limits.

- **design_principles_cognitive_load.md**  
  Formalizes the core design principles derived from cognitive load theory, working memory limitations, and attentional control.

---

## 2. Project Definition & Scope

These documents define *what* is being studied and *why*.

- **project_overview.md**  
  High level description of the research motivation, goals, and overall structure of the project.

- **project_scope.md**  
  Specifies the focused usage context (late-night interaction under fatigue), the cognitive failure being examined, and the intended design outcomes.

## 3. Interface Case Studies

These files analyze real-world interfaces through a cognitive lens, identifying sources of extraneous cognitive load.

- **interface_case_study_instagram.md**  
  Cognitive analysis of Instagram’s infinite scroll, visual instability, and attentional capture mechanisms.

- **interface_case_study_spotify.md**  
  Examination of Spotify’s navigation structure, algorithmic uncertainty, and split-attention demands.

## 4. Cognitive Load Audit

- **cognitive_load_audit.md**  
  Systematic identification of extraneous cognitive load sources across the studied interfaces, explici

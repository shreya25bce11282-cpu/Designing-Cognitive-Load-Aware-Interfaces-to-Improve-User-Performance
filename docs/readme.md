# Documentation Guide  
*Cognitive Load–Aware Interface Design*

This directory contains the theoretical analysis, cognitive audits, and design rationale supporting the Cognitive Load–Aware Interface Design project.

The documents are structured to reflect a research-style progression:
from psychological theory → interface analysis → design intervention → evaluation.

Readers are encouraged to follow the order below for conceptual clarity.

---

## 1. Theoretical & Conceptual Foundation

These documents establish the cognitive science principles that guide all later analysis and design decisions.

- **hci_intro.md**  
  Introduces the project from a Human–Computer Interaction and cognitive psychology perspective, outlining why cognitive constraints should act as design limits.

- **design_principles_cognitive_load.md**  
  Formalizes the core design principles derived from cognitive load theory, working memory limitations, and attentional control.

---

## 2. Project Definition & Scope

These documents define *what* is being studied and *why*.

- **project_overview.md**  
  High-level description of the research motivation, goals, and overall structure of the project.

- **project_scope.md**  
  Specifies the focused usage context (late-night interaction under fatigue), the cognitive failure being examined, and the intended design outcomes.

---

## 3. Interface Case Studies

These files analyze real-world interfaces through a cognitive lens, identifying sources of extraneous cognitive load.

- **interface_case_study_instagram.md**  
  Cognitive analysis of Instagram’s infinite scroll, visual instability, and attentional capture mechanisms.

- **interface_case_study_spotify.md**  
  Examination of Spotify’s navigation structure, algorithmic uncertainty, and split-attention demands.

---

## 4. Cognitive Load Audit

- **cognitive_load_audit.md**  
  Systematic identification of extraneous cognitive load sources across the studied interfaces, explicitly mapped to cognitive mechanisms such as working memory overload and sustained attentional demand.

---

## 5. Design Interventions

These documents translate cognitive theory into concrete interface-level changes.

- **design_intervention_instagram.md**  
  Proposed cognitively aligned redesign of Instagram’s interaction flow, supported by theoretical rationale and wireframes.

- **design_intervention_spotify.md**  
  Design recommendations for reducing monitoring and prediction load in Spotify’s interface.

Visual assets supporting the Instagram intervention are located in the **assets/** directory.

---

## 6. Design Evaluation

- **design_evaluation.md**  
  Conceptual evaluation of the proposed interventions, discussing expected cognitive benefits, trade-offs, and alignment with psychological theory.  
  This section outlines how the designs could be empirically validated in future work.

---

## Reading Note

This project prioritizes **theory-driven design reasoning** over implementation or engagement optimization.  
The documentation-first structure reflects a cognitive science research approach rather than a product-design workflow.

---

## Intended Audience

- Cognitive Science and Psychology graduate programs  
- Human–Computer Interaction researchers  
- Human-centered technology and UX researchers  

The documentation is written to demonstrate research thinking, theoretical grounding, and cognitive rigor.

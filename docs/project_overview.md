# Project Overview

### 1. Project Motivation

Modern digital interfaces are designed to maximize engagement rather than align with human cognitive limits.
This often leads to attentional fatigue, working memory overload, and increased stress, especially during late night or prolonged usage.

This project investigates **how interface design contributes to cognitive overload**, and explores **design interventions grounded in cognitive psychology** to reduce unnecessary mental effort.

---

### 2. Psychological Foundation

This project is grounded in established cognitive psychology concepts:

* **Working Memory Limits**: Humans can process ~4 chunks of information at a time.
* **Attention is Finite**: Sustained attention requires recovery; continuous capture leads to breakdown.
* **Cognitive Load Theory**:

  * *Intrinsic Load*: effort required by the task itself
  * *Extraneous Load*: effort caused by poor design
  * *Germane Load*: effort used for meaningful learning

The project focuses on **reducing extraneous cognitive load** caused by interface design.

### 3. Interfaces Studied

Two widely used real-world platforms were analyzed:

#### Instagram

* Primary issue: **Sustained attentional capture**
* Causes:

  * Infinite scroll
  * High affordance density
  * No stopping cues or session boundaries

#### Spotify

* Primary issue: **Prediction and monitoring load**
* Causes:

  * Algorithmic uncertainty
  * Autoplay without clear endpoints
  * Hidden navigation structures

These platforms were chosen because they represent **different cognitive overload mechanisms**.

---

### 4. Cognitive Load Audit

Each interface was evaluated using a **theory driven cognitive audit**, examining:

* Sources of extraneous load
* Impact on attention and working memory
* How design elements force continuous cognitive effort

This evaluation did not rely on user testing, but on **established cognitive principles**, consistent with early stage HCI research.

---

### 5. Design Interventions

Based on the audit, **cognitive goal driven design interventions** were proposed.

#### Key Design Strategies

* Reduce visible actions per screen
* Introduce stopping cues and session boundaries
* Increase predictability of system behavior
* Reduce simultaneous visual and attentional demands

Wireframe was created (using Figma) to illustrate how these principles could be applied in practice.

---

### 6. Evaluation Approach

The proposed designs were evaluated using **heuristic cognitive evaluation**, assessing whether they:

* Reduce extraneous cognitive load
* Respect attentional limits
* Protect working memory capacity

Although no empirical user testing was conducted, the designs were evaluated against **psychological correctness and cognitive plausibility**.

---

### 7. Key Insights

* Different interfaces overload cognition in different ways.
* Attention overload and prediction overload require **different design solutions**.
* Small interface changes (stopping cues, predictability, reduced affordances) can significantly reduce cognitive strain.
* Cognitive psychology provides a powerful framework for evaluating and improving interface design.

---

### 8. Limitations

* No quantitative user testing was performed.
* Designs are conceptual and exploratory.
* Findings are theory driven rather than experimentally validated.

These limitations are intentional and appropriate for an **early stage cognitive design research project**.

---

### 9. Relevance to HCI & Cognitive Science

This project demonstrates the ability to:

* Apply cognitive psychology to real world interfaces
* Translate theory into design reasoning
* Think like an HCI researcher rather than a surface level designer

It forms a foundation for future work involving **user studies, experimental validation, and interactive systems**.

---

### 10. Project Status

**Project 2 is complete.**
Future iterations may include usability testing, behavioral metrics, or interactive prototypes.

# Interface Case Study: Instagram (Late-Night Scrolling)

## Context of Use
This case study focuses on a common late night usage scenario where users engage in prolonged, passive scrolling on Instagram, often under conditions of fatigue and reduced self regulation.

At this time, attentional resources are already depleted, making users more vulnerable to cognitive overload and stress.

---

## Primary User Goal
To consume social content in a low effort, relaxing manner without explicit intention to continue indefinitely.

---

## Identified Cognitive Failure
The primary cognitive failure observed is **sustained attentional engagement without recovery**.

Instagram’s infinite scroll design provides:
- No stopping cues
- No task completion signals
- No natural rest points

This forces continuous attentional deployment and prevents cognitive disengagement.

---

## Sources of Extraneous Cognitive Load

### 1. Visually Unstable Feed
Content (faces, text, colors, motion) constantly changes in the same spatial location, forcing the brain to repeatedly re-parse the visual scene.

This creates continuous perceptual decoding load.

### 2. High Affordance Density
Multiple actionable elements (like, comment, share, save, follow, audio, tags) are presented simultaneously.

The brain must constantly suppress irrelevant actions, increasing working memory and inhibitory control load.

### 3. Absence of Segmentation
The lack of chapters, pauses, or session boundaries removes opportunities for attentional recovery.

---

## Cognitive Load Analysis
These design patterns primarily increase **extraneous cognitive load**, placing unnecessary demand on working memory and attention systems without contributing to meaningful engagement or learning.

Over time, this results in attentional fatigue and subjective stress.

## Cognitive-Goal–Driven Redesign Concept

### Design Goal
To restore attentional awareness and provide a natural stopping point without removing user autonomy.

## Intended Psychological Effect
- Interrupts attentional trance
- Reintroduces task completion signals
- Reduces sustained cognitive load
- Supports self regulation during low energy states

---

## Link to Cognitive Theory
This redesign is grounded in:
- Working memory limitations
- Cognitive load theory
- Attentional fatigue research

By introducing soft stopping cues, the interface reduces extraneous cognitive load and supports healthier cognitive engagement.

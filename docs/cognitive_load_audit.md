# Cognitive Load Audit of Real Interfaces

This audit identifies sources of extraneous cognitive load by mapping interface features directly to known cognitive constraints.

## Interface 1: Instagram

### Primary Task
Connect with others and consume or share short-form visual content.

### Sources of Extraneous Cognitive Load
- Visually unstable feed where content constantly changes in the same screen location

- High affordance density (like, comment, share, save, follow, audio, tags all visible at once)

- Infinite scrolling with no natural stopping points or session boundaries

### Why This Overloads Working Memory
- Instagram forces the user to repeatedly re parse the visual environment, preventing perceptual habituation.

- The presence of many simultaneous action options requires continuous evaluation and inhibition, placing load on working memory and executive control.

- The lack of stopping cues forces sustained attention and vigilance, which leads to attentional fatigue and working memory overload.

## Interface 2: Spotify

### Primary Task
Listen to music or podcasts.

### Sources of Extraneous Cognitive Load
- Algorithmic uncertainty about upcoming songs or recommendations

- Visual multitasking elements such as lyrics, canvas animations, and notifications during listening

- Hidden navigation complexity through nested menus and gesture-based controls

### Why This Overloads Working Memory
- Uncertainty about what comes next forces continuous prediction and monitoring, consuming cognitive resources.

- Simultaneous visual and auditory information splits attention across modalities, increasing cognitive load.

- Hidden navigation rules require users to actively remember interface structures, shifting cognitive effort from the primary task to interface management.

# Cognitive Load Case Study: Spotify

## Context of Use
This case study focuses on users listening to music or podcasts while studying, commuting, or winding down. In these situations, the primary intention is passive consumption with minimal cognitive effort.

## Primary User Goal
Listen to audio content without having to actively monitor or manage the interface.

## Primary Cognitive Failure
Background cognitive load caused by algorithmic uncertainty and unnecessary visual engagement during listening.

## Sources of Extraneous Cognitive Load

### Algorithmic Uncertainty
Autoplay, recommendations, and shuffled playlists create uncertainty about upcoming content.
- The user does not know what will play next.
- This forces the brain to stay in a low level prediction and monitoring state.

### Visual Multitasking
Lyrics, canvas animations, recommendations, and notifications appear while audio is playing.
- The brain is forced to split attention between auditory and visual streams.
- This increases working memory and attentional load despite the task being passive.

### Hidden Navigation Complexity
Multiple nested menus, swipe gestures, and unclear navigation paths.
- The user must remember interface rules and navigation structure.
- This places memory load on the user instead of allowing habitual interaction.

## Why This Overloads Working Memory
Even during passive listening, the interface demands prediction, monitoring, and memory recall. These processes occupy working memory resources unnecessarily, leading to cognitive fatigue rather than relaxation.

## Cognitive Design Goal
Minimize background cognitive load during listening by reducing visual interference, lowering prediction demands, and simplifying navigation so that audio consumption remains cognitively lightweight.

## Design Direction (Future Scope)
A listening-focused mode that suppresses visual stimuli and stabilizes playback behavior to support sustained attention and mental recovery.

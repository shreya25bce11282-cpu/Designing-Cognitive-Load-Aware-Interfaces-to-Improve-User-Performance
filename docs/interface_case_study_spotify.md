# Cognitive Load Case Study: Spotify

## Context of Use
This case study focuses on a user listening to music while studying or winding down.

## Primary User Goal
Listen to audio content with minimal cognitive effort.

## Primary Cognitive Failure
Sustained background cognitive load caused by algorithmic uncertainty and visual multitasking.

## Sources of Extraneous Cognitive Load
- Unpredictable autoplay and recommendations
- Simultaneous visual and auditory stimuli
- Hidden navigation paths and gestures

## Why This Overloads Working Memory
The interface forces the brain to continuously monitor, predict, and evaluate content, consuming working memory resources that should remain unused during passive listening.

## Cognitive Design Goal
Reduce background cognitive load by minimizing prediction demands and visual interference.

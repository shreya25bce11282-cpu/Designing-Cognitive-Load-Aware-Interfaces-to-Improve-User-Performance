# Introduction to Human–Computer Interaction

## What is HCI?
Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is the study of how humans interact with computer systems, and how those systems can be designed to align with human cognitive abilities and limitations.

HCI sits at the intersection of:
- Psychology (how humans think)
- Design (how information is presented)
- Technology (how systems behave)

If UI is the surface, HCI is the mind.

## Why Cognition Matters in Interface Design
Humans are not optimal processors. We operate under several cognitive constraints:

- **Limited attention:** We can focus on a subject only for a limited duration before performance declines.
- **Limited working memory:** Working memory can process only about four meaningful chunks of information at a time. Excess information leads to cognitive overload.
- **Limited mental energy:** Sustained cognitive effort is metabolically expensive and cannot be maintained indefinitely.

Interfaces that ignore these limits increase errors, stress, and disengagement.

## What is Cognitive Load?
Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort being used in working memory at a given moment. When cognitive load exceeds working memory capacity, performance deteriorates.

## Types of Cognitive Load
- **Intrinsic Load:** Load that comes from the task itself (e.g., solving a mathematics problem).
- **Extraneous Load:** Load caused by poor design (e.g., cluttered dashboards, unclear instructions, too many options at once).
- **Germane Load:** Productive mental effort used for learning and building understanding (e.g., forming meaningful connections).

## Why Poor Interface Design Causes Cognitive Overload
Poorly designed interfaces increase extraneous cognitive load through:
- Excessive choices
- Poor visual hierarchy
- Multitasking demands
- Unclear task flow
- Simultaneous notifications

All of these place unnecessary strain on working memory.

## How This Leads to My Project
In my first project, I demonstrated how sleep quality affects stress, which in turn impacts cognitive efficiency. This project investigates whether well designed interfaces can protect human cognition even when users are tired, stressed, or cognitively overloaded.
